<p>   Hi, I am Shuo Chen. In this process of my writing I want to make my essay fit with reality at the beginning of my writing, not just imagination, I like the idea of evidence, I think the idea of evidence is the most real, in addition I like to use some documents or articles as evidence in my essay, and do not like to use some videos as evidence, because I think the article will show the point more directly, and Videos always confuse me as to what is better to use as evidence. In my autobiography, I describe my life and the life I want to live in the future.</p>

<p>Robin Wall Kimmerer is a mother, scientist, professor emerita, and registered member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. She thinks we only have humans as guests. We recorded, edited, and published only human-to-human conversations. She believes that humans and other creatures shape each other's lives in many ways, for better or worse. She is very concerned with how our lives are integrated with the lives of other creatures, and how these creatures are interconnected. She believes that all creatures are connected to each other accordingly. Robin Wall Kimmerer believes in species democracy and that all humans and non-humans should have rights. In our lives, we should give due consideration to other parts of nature, because I don't think there is equality between humans and non-humans, non-humans don’t have the same as humans have, and they shouldn’t have in the future as well, because most people can't live without animals, such as food, medicine development, decoration, clothes, and furniture. I think diversity and inclusion provide a space where all people have equal access to opportunities and resources and will make everyone feel valued and accepted, and everyone has a voice. Diversity and inclusion make people feel freer and make people feel safe by respecting and appreciating other people in terms of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and nationality because then people have their own power and so people will build a stronger sense of identity and happiness. Although I believe that humans and non-humans are not equal, we as humans also have to be responsible for this community of humans and non-humans, for the earth, after all, resources are not infinite, for the limited resources we have to protect and conserve these resources, rather than unlimited waste, as a human a species with strong rational thinking, Yo-Yo Ma also mentioned “we humans have dual neural pathways, one for critical thinking and one for empathetic thinking.”(Yo-Yo ma line 10).  In the sentence, he means humans have critical thinking, so they are rational, but they also have emotional thinking, and this emotional thinking can affect us to a great extent. we can use these resources at the same time, but also in other ways for its restoration. Now that human prosperity has taken a heavy toll on the natural non-human environment and wildlife, it is all the more important that we protect the environment and restore it to make our planet a better place. So I don't think there is equality between humans and non-humans, after all, most people can't live without animals. But then, in such a diverse and inclusive society, such society, we can tolerate humans and non-humans as much as possible, and through compassion among humans, we can also protect non-humans to some extent. After all, the Earth's resources are not infinite, so we need to save the earth's resources and protect the environment as much as possible.</p>

  <h4></h4>
  <p>First, I have a different view than Robin Wall Kimmerer. I believe that humans and non-humans are not equal, that humans cannot live without non-humans, and that if non-humans and humans were equal, then where would the wood we need to build houses come from, and we would not have as many houses? Every time we clean a room, floor, or table, we kill thousands of microorganisms and bacteria, and if we should treat them with respect and equality, we should not let them survive by not moving at all. In this era, many diseases are fought by human beings, and when we develop new drugs and vaccines, we need mice to conduct experiments to deploy the drugs and vaccines that work best for us. If it is the democratization of humans and non-humans, then human medical technology will not be able to improve, which leads to various diseases in humans, then human beings will decrease rapidly and most likely after a long time without the ability to cure thus leading to the extinction of the human race. In addition, humans need to eat non-human processed food to maintain their own nutrition, humans need to eat vegetables or animal meat to survive, and this non-human food for humans is indispensable, when humans and non-humans achieve democracy, then how many animals and plants are willing to sacrifice themselves to maintain the survival of humans? Then the answer is obviously very little so humans simply can not survive. In ancient times although it may be more equal between humans and non-humans, that is only because the number of humans is not as many as it is now, and in the past, humans did not have very many tools at their disposal, so it is not that humans do not want to but the ability is not so great. In our lives, we also need furniture and clothes made by non-humans, and we as human beings are indispensable for these, and we as human beings cannot sleep on the grass every day without clothes. All humans and non-humans cannot be equal, and we humans, at the apex of the pyramid, should have access to these non-human resources according to our ability. Human welfare is based on the exploitation of other animals and plants in the natural world. Humans can get meat, milk, and fur from animals with peace of mind because we are at the top of the earth's food chain, which is the precious heritage of our ancestors after millions of years of fighting. And humans protect animals only to continue the ecological chain so that they have more resources to use, not because people and animals are equal.</p>

  <h4></h4>
  <p>Second, I think diversity and inclusion give all people equal access to opportunities and resources, make people feel freer, make people feel safe by respecting and appreciating other people's gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and nationality, and people build a stronger sense of identity and well-being. Yo-Yo Ma said in his article  “My musical journeys have reinforced this point of view. What I've found is that the interactions brought about by globalization don't just destroy culture; they can create a new culture and invigorate and spread traditions that have existed for ages precisely because of the ‘edge effect.’ Sometimes the most interesting things happen at the edge. The intersections there can reveal unexpected connections”(Ma Behind the Cello). This part of his article talks about how the collision of diverse cultures can be destructive, but there is an imperceptible relationship between cultures that creates inclusiveness, and these frictions and collisions can lead to new cultures. And this collision and combination of cultures create a new culture, which in turn can inspire and spread a long-standing culture that previously did not interest young people. Whereas Robin Wall Kimmerer was talking about the differences between human and natural laws and how it would be easier if they were more aligned in practice, like human laws in democracy, she argued that we should be inclusive of non-humans, just like our human communities, and she called for human-constructed governance and economies to be aligned with natural laws. Robin says in the video “When at their most vulnerable they come to us”(Robin 12:11). This tells us when a non-human comes to us and asks for help, we should help them because humans possess compassion. Compassion is a fundamental mechanism for maintaining relationships within the human species and is one of the foundations of social relationships. After millions of years of evolution, normal-minded humans have their own system of perfect emotional control and feedback, which keeps the level of killing and bloodlust at a very low level.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Third, although I believe that humans and non-humans are not equal, equality in law is the ability of social subjects to receive equal treatment, including formal and substantive equality. So I think humans and non-humans are not equal, and I don't think non-humans can enjoy the same treatment as humans. But the environment of the earth is for everyone, and human prosperity has brought serious losses to the natural environment and wildlife of non-humans. We should protect and restore the environment to make our earth a better place. In our lives we keep pets, and this is a responsible behavior for us humans to the non-human community, and the non-human community, we as a human with strong rational thinking, should protect and restore it while using the resources. Yo-Yo Ma also talked in his article that a human is a human with rational thinking and emotional thinking. He said “Only one pathway can be activated at a time, so when one is on, the other is off. Yet we are also aware that wise and balanced judgment results from integrating the critical and empathetic, taking emotions as well as reason into account. While this can't be done in tandem, it does occur, we now know, through a loop-back process of layers of feedback”(Ma Behind the Cello). Here it is mentioned that humans have dual neural pathways, one for critical thinking and the other for emotional thinking. I think that human beings are able to protect the environment according to their rational thinking, instead of being influenced by their emotional thinking to a large extent, thus causing the environment to become worse and worse due to other things. For Kimmerer, we humans should be responsible for what we do, not consistently avoid responsibility and irresponsibility. I think that if we as human beings do not do something to remedy the damage we have caused to the earth and the loss of resources, then soon the earth will be destroyed by human hands and human beings will disappear in history, because at that time we will not be able to remedy it, so we should do what we can to restore the environment now that we still have the chance. In Robin's video, she tells us that “A message that we reach to understand I think earth asks more of us than gratitude the earth asks that we give our gifts in return so that the world can continue”(Robin 12:50). This in her video tells us that we as human beings should remain in awe of nature. We should not only be grateful for what nature has given us, but we should also take practical actions to feed nature and make the non-human and human communities better, we humans are the ones who use the most of nature's resources. Therefore, since human beings have both ideal and emotional ways of thinking, we human beings should be able to use these two ways of thinking to make our global environment better, and when we use the earth's resources for survival, we should also ideally consider whether the earth's resources will be enough for our future generations, and consider how to improve the earth's environment, and how to save or increase the earth's resources.</li>
    <li>In conclusion, Robin Wall Kimmel believes that we only treat humans as guests. We only record, edit and publish human-to-human conversations. She believes that humans and other creatures shape each other's lives in many ways, for better or worse. She is very concerned with how our lives are integrated with the lives of other creatures and how these creatures are interconnected. Believes that all humans and non-humans should have rights. I think we should give due consideration to other parts of nature because I don't think there is equality between humans and non-humans because most people can't live without animals. And diversity and inclusion make people feel freer and make people feel safe by respecting and appreciating other people's gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and nationality because then people have their own power, so people build a stronger sense of identity and happiness. Although I believe that humans and non-humans are not equal, we as humans also have to be responsible for this community of humans and non-humans and for the earth, after all, resources are not infinite and for the limited resources we have to protect and conserve these resources. To summarize the above, we only record, edit and publish human-to-human conversations, yet have the greatest impact on this human and non-human community. We should make more groups feel freer through diversity and inclusion, and build a stronger sense of identity and well-being by making groups feel safe through respect and appreciation for other humans and non-humans. And I think we should give due consideration to other parts of nature because I don't think there is equality between humans and nonhumans. Because most people cannot live without animals, such as food, medicine development, decoration, clothes, and furniture. But we as humans are also responsible for this community of humans and non-humans and for the earth, after all, resources are not infinite, we humans have critical thinking and are rational, and all the more we should be responsible for the damage we do to the earth and repair it. Although human beings protect animals just to continue the ecological chain, so that they have more resources to use, not because people and animals are equal, so human beings can both be content to get meat, milk, and fur from animals, because we are at the top of the earth's food chain, which is the valuable heritage of our ancestors left after millions of years of fighting. But at the same time, there must also exist some compassion for other animals, because compassion is a fundamental mechanism for maintaining relationships within the human species, and is one of the foundations of social relations. Kimmerer believes that all living things are correspondingly interconnected, and she believes in species democracy. I, however, believe that there can be no species democracy for humans and non-humans and that humans, at the top of the food chain, should demand what they need. But because humans and nonhumans are different and humans have different ways of thinking, humans also conserve these resources and thus use them in the long run.</li>
